To run scoreNormalizer.py: 

1: cd to /web/CSE442-542/2019-Summer/cse-442e/env (make sure you are in this directory)
2: type source bin/activate.csh
3: type python3.4 scoreNormalizer.py CSE112 (where I say CSE112 put the course you'd like 
   to grab students scores from, make sure to type it correctly or you will get an empty
   .csv).
